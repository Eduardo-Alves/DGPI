N-term Signal :
  there is a N-term signal   (1..33)
  maximal score=11.89

C-term Hydrophobicity profile :
  hydrophobe length (low-pass filter)=21
  hydrophile length (low-pass filter)=1
  hydrophobe length (median filter)=16
  hydrophile length (median filter)=19
  average hydrophobe length = 18.5
  average hydrophile length = 10.0

Cleavage site (w) :
  There's a GPI-anchor near 604  (7 aa after hydrophobic tail)
  There's a potential cleavage site at 604 (score=0.344) detected by w, w+2 rule.
  The best cleavage site is 604

Conclusion :
  This protein is GPI-anchored (signal, hydrophobic & hydrophilic tail present).
  There is a potential cleavage site at 604 (w, w+1, w+2)
